      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>My name is Aaron Turner. There are a lot of things about me that even I myself is yet to discover. But one thing I know now about myself are that I can be very crazy sometimes with people. But I do have my reasons.</p>
      <p> Sometimes it’s because I’m hiding what I feel deep down or when I see others down I just want to cheer them up, and what’s better than a crazy friend who would do nothing but stare at you like a weirdo until he sees a smile on their face. I love to see people happy, but then again, sometimes I don’t. There is a darker side of me. I believe everyone has a dark side, and I don’t mean by “May the force be with us” kind of thing. But a dark side that makes us probably do stuff that we wouldn’t usually do. But like everyone else, I am only human.</p>
